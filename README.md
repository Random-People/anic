*Incomplete* Compiler for the dead language ANI.

**This compilier does not produce code.**

It appears to have been abandoned for about four and a half years before I found it.
It is a fascinating language and I hope to integrate some of it's better ideas into flow.
I am happy to accept patches and keep this from bitrotting.
